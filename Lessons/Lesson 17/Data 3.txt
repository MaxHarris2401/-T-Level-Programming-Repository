Cleansing - Cleansing data is hiding and removing errors, inconsistencies, and missing entries from data to increase the quality
Validation - Checking the accuracy and quality of the source data before using or processing data.

Core functions
    - All data systems have the same basic functions, how they are used will depend on the data being processed and the desired outcome
    - Our core functions of a data system are:
        - Input - for the collection of raw data
        - Search - Searches can be carried out on the data to meet the needs and requrirements of the organisation
        - Save - data that's been input into a system can be stored and then used again
        - Integrate - Different data types and formats can be integrated into a single location, and is used to build full and complete outputs that meet the requirements

        - Organise (Index) - Saved data can be organised and indexed, an index increases speed of searching data, as you wont have to search every record
