Program code
- usually considered to be the code written to solve the problem which follows the rules of the programming language.
- however, program code can also be used to create algorithms, which is known a "draft program code"
- draft code can have errors as it will not be used as final code as long as the meaning is clear how the program should work
- this is pointless
- Advantages:
    - it is very probable that the person creating the algorithm will have some programming knowledge
    - It is not necessary to ue the correct syntax
    - all the required constructs will be available to be included in draft code
- Disadvantages:
    - Easy to begin creating draft code but end up creating the final code
    - Full decomposition may not be completed
Dry run testing
- used to test a small part of a program
    - an algorithm
    - a function or procedure
- the programmer follows the code through manually using test data to check that the code is correct.
- programmer documents changes in values of variables as each line of code is executed using a trace table.
Trace tables
- person behaving as a computer
- each column used to document the value of a particular variables
- each row represents the values of the variables at a given point in the program execution
- every time there is an assignment statement in the code, the programmer writes the value assigned to the variable on the trace table
- at the end the programmer should be able to see if the algorithm produced the expected results.
- a new row is started for each iteration of a loop or each time processing is repeated, not all cells will necassarily be filled in
