A problem solving method using computer science techniques, where possibole solutions are developed and presented in a way that can be understood by humans and computers
Decomposition
- Breaking a complex problem into smaller sub-problems
Abstraction
- The process of removing or filtering characteristics that are not needed in order to focus on important characteristics
Top Down
- All about ising Decomposition to break that problem down
- Where the top nmost node is most abstracted and sub nodes become less abstracted as they are decomposed.
Bottom up
- Opposite of top down, focuses on solving the smallest part, e.g a module, of a problem
- These are then combined to move up a level, until you reach the end, this is called integration.
